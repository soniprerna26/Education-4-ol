## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used the flex property and learned to make a website responsive. 

```css
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  .flex {
      display: initial;
      align-items: center;
      align-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue cleaning my code and learn more about small animations.
